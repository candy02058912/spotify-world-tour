## About this project

Spotify World Tour is a web application that allows users to explore music from around the world through [Spotify](https://developer.spotify.com/). Select a country on the map (created through [Mapbox](https://docs.mapbox.com/)) and various albums and playlists will populate based on the filters you select.

_Note: Log-in functionality does not work at this time. Use of Spotify's API in third-party apps is [limited to 25 users which can only be registered to the app by its owner.](https://developer.spotify.com/community/news/2021/05/27/improving-the-developer-and-user-experience-for-third-party-apps/)_
